	<!-- cartridges contain the ROM only, the XaviX CPU and BIOS are in the base unit -->

	<!--
	These are bundled/pack-in cartridges that don't appear to be part of any other series.
	Some pack-in carts were just part of the regular line-ups instead, eg S-1 with the
	Hello Kitty units, those are in their respective lists.

	The numbering for the ones here is a little unusual

	Both KR-1 and PR-06 cart have 'AC0009' on the PCB (along with a PR0006 sticker)

	*KR-1      Kirarin Revolution (comes in kira kara Starter Set bundled with Kirarin Revolution microphone) (inside cart is marked AC0009-KIR)
	*PR-06     Misora Hibari (inside cart is marked AC0009)
	*BX01-MOR  Morning Musume Special (sticker inside cart is marked CS019-004A)

	The following cartridges with 'PR' codes have also been seen, they appear to be single song cartridges
	and it is unknown how they were distributed (maybe pack-ins, but no pack-in box has been identified)
	These are bright pink in colour with blue/white paper labels

	PR-01 MNG  (c)2002   Morning Musume - I'm Here!
	PR-02 AYY  (c)2003   Aya Matsuura - Prairies Man

	maybe PR03 to PR05 also exist?

	(more?)
